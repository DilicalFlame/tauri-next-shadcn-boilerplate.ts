# Introduction

Welcome to the **Tauri Next Shadcn Template** documentation. This boilerplate is designed to help you build professional, high-performance desktop applications using modern web technologies and Rust.

## Tech Stack

This template combines the best tools in the ecosystem:

- **[Tauri v2](https://tauri.app/)**: The framework for building tiny, fast binaries for all major desktop platforms.
- **[Next.js 16](https://nextjs.org/)**: The React framework for the web, providing a robust structure for your frontend.
- **[React 19](https://react.dev/)**: The library for web and native user interfaces.
- **[Shadcn UI](https://ui.shadcn.com/)**: Beautifully designed components built with Radix UI and Tailwind CSS.
- **[Tailwind CSS 4](https://tailwindcss.com/)**: A utility-first CSS framework for rapid UI development.
- **[Biome](https://biomejs.dev/)**: A fast formatter and linter for JavaScript, TypeScript, JSX, and JSON.

## Key Features

- **Pre-configured Logger**: A robust logging system that bridges Frontend and Backend logs.
- **Window Management**: Utilities to handle window state and locking.
- **Tauri Service**: A clean abstraction layer for invoking Rust commands.
- **Professional Docs**: This documentation site itself is part of the template!

## Philosophy

This boilerplate aims to be **opinionated but flexible**. We provide a solid structure for services, logging, and UI, but we don't lock you into complex abstractions. You can easily rip out what you don't need.
